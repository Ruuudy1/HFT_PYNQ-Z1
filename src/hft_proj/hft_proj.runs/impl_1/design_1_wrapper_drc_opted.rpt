UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
F7 Muxes over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more F7 Muxes cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 39946 of such cell types but only 26600 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT

UTLZ-1#2 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
LUT as Distributed RAM over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more LUT as Distributed RAM cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 88592 of such cell types but only 17400 compatible sites are available in the target device.

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/fast_protocol_0/inst/rxPath_U0/mul_16s_9ns_16_1_1_U23/tmp_product multiplier stage design_1_i/fast_protocol_0/inst/rxPath_U0/mul_16s_9ns_16_1_1_U23/tmp_product/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
